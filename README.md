A new Flutter project.
This repository documents the 6-hour coding session for the Codethon, where we participated in a highly competitive hackathon at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore. 
Our team focused on creating an innovative solution that not only met the requirements but also addressed real-world challenges. 
We received significant appreciation from the judges for our intuitive layout design and the unique features we implemented.

Throughout the event, we collaborated effectively, showcasing strong teamwork and problem-solving skills.
Despite not winning the prize, we were proud of our performance and received a round of applause for our designs, layout, and the simplicity of our background color, which enhanced user experience.

This experience allowed us to enhance our technical skills, learn new technologies, and gain valuable insights into the software development process.
We also built connections with fellow participants and industry professionals, further enriching our understanding of current trends in technology.
